# Contributor Guidelines

The `main` branch is protected. Please develop on a branch and create pull requests following this [Git Workflow],
and request a review from at least one other person before merging.

In your PR description:
* Summarize your change
* What tests have you added to verify that your change works as intended?
  * can be a Rust unit test, or a simple one-line call in `main` function, or a shell command. 
* What feedback do you want from the reviewer?

Reviewers:
* Check out this branch and compile and test the change following the description.
* Give style feedback as well as logic / correctness feedback.

Note: this will slowdown development on `main` so that teammates have a chance to learn.
Please continue developing as fast as you like on your own dev branch.
