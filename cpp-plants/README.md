## CPP plants 

First things first. The makefile. 

This is my old template makefile. its been a while sense I really put thought into it so, it could use some improvements.
That being said. Currently. if you have an object you want to add to be compiled with make. you copy the example called TEMPLATE and replace the word TEMPLATE and then add the name to the list of OBJ. We can probably clean this up, however. 

Things will be compiled into the folder with the name of the compiler. If you wanna change compiler, Just know it will need to make that folder.
