## Suffix Trees
There are 2 separate suffix tree visualizers in this project: the open source Ukkonen's Algorithm visualizer and one being written in React for this project.

Differences: 
The Ukkonen Visualizer includes a termination character "$" and shows suffix links while the React visualizer currently doesn't
